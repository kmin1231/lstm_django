## `Python` Prediction on Stock Price Movement with LSTM Model
<i>[CSE406-12] KHU Capstone Design</i> (team project)

<br>

## Project Overview
- This project utilizes the **`LSTM`** (Long Short-Term Memory) model, a deep learning technique under the **RNN** (Recurrent Neural Network) family, to predict **stock price movements**.
- To address the **limitation** of using only past stock price data, which fails to account for **external factors**, this project incorporates the **`KOSPI index`** into the model. This approach is expected to enhance the prediction accuracy of individual stock price movements.
- The prediction results are provided through a **web-based interface** in various forms, such as graphs and tables.

<br>

## Page Overview
This project uses the **`Django`** framework to build the web application.

**`Main`**
- main screen of the website
- shows the actual stock price graph for Samsung Electronics (005930)

**`Predict`**
- displays **prediction results** generated by the **algorithm** in a **graph** format

**`History`**
- provides a **table** for comparing and analyzing historical data

<br>

## Python Libraries
- **`Django`**: provides functions such as template rendering and database management for web application
- **`finance-datareader`**: fetches financial data (Samsung Electronics daily stock prices, KOSPI)
- **`tensorflow`**: supports deep learning model implementation and training
- **`keras`**: defines and trains the LSTM model
- **`h5py`**: saves and manages the model in `HDF5` format
- **`matplotlib`**: visualizes actual stock prices and prediction results
- **`scikit-learn`**: handles data preprocessing and splits the training data
